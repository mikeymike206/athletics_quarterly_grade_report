# Seattle University Athletics Quarterly Academic Dashboard

## Background and Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive academic snapshot of Seattle University’s student-athletes, updated quarterly and shared with key campus stakeholders including coaches, advisors, and administrators. It tracks performance trends across all athletic teams and supports data-informed decisions around eligibility, academic support, and recognition.

In recent years, the increasing number of transfer student-athletes—partly due to NCAA rule changes allowing multiple transfers without penalty—has made it essential to monitor how transfers perform compared to First-Time-in-College (FTIC) students. This tool allows stakeholders to assess those differences and make tailored academic or recruiting recommendations.

Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022), many courses transitioned online, and temporary grading options (Credit/No Credit) were implemented. These changes may have impacted GPA calculations during that period and should be considered when reviewing historical data.

## Data Structure and Overview

The dataset consists of term-level academic performance for all student-athletes by team, GPA range, academic standing, and demographics.
